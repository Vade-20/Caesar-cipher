# Caesar-cipher

This is a Python script that implements the Caesar cipher using the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides two modes: encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **Encryption**: You can encrypt a given plaintext by specifying a shift value.
- **Decryption**: You can decrypt a given ciphertext by specifying the original shift value used for encryption.
- **Clipboard Integration**: If no text is provided, the script will automatically copy the text from the clipboard, making it convenient for quick encryption or decryption.
- **Output Display**: The result of the cipher operation is displayed in the GUI, allowing you to easily view the encrypted or decrypted text.
- **Clipboard Copy**: The output is also copied to the clipboard for easy sharing or further usage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vade-20/Caesar-cipher.git
